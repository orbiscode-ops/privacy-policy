  <h1>Privacy Policy - OrbisCode</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all applications and services provided by <strong>OrbisCode</strong>, including <em>Trimify</em> and any other apps published under the same developer account.</p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>Our applications do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data from users unless it is strictly required for the app’s core functionality (for example: access to files, media, storage, or network).</p>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect sensitive or personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, contact information, or location.</p>
  <p>If an app requests permission (e.g. storage, audio, camera), it is used <strong>only locally</strong> on your device for the intended feature, and no data is transmitted to our servers.</p>

  <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
  <p>Any data accessed by the app is used <strong>solely to provide and improve</strong> its core features and user experience. We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share user data with any third parties for advertising, tracking, or analytics purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our apps operate locally and do not send or store any personal data online. We implement reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure of information processed within the app.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Some of our applications may include optional links to third-party websites or services (for example, help pages or social links). We are <strong>not responsible</strong> for the content or privacy practices of those external sites. We recommend that users review the privacy policies of any third-party services accessed through our apps.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
  <p>Our apps themselves do <strong>not</strong> use cookies. However, if an external webpage is opened from within the app, that site may use cookies according to its own policy.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.</p>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
